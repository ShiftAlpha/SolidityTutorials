# SolidityTutorials
Tutorials on Solidity Ethereum

Majority of these files contain programs collected and rewritten to better understand the solidity programming language. Each file has been carefully written and commented(majority) to better understand this language. I do have several more files which will be pushed soon.

I started this journey of decentrializing applications in 2017 and have come to a proficient understanding of how to start , program and deploy an application on the etheruem blockchain.

The solidity programming language is one that is extremely difficult to grasp at first but through countless hours of coding and recoding and bettering others projects. I have created a few folders in which help get one started.

Through constant youtube videos explaining tutorials on the vast several topics the Solidity language requires - I now have a better understanding.

As an ethical programmer I give thanks to all those that have mentored me throughout this journey. I also give thanks to myself to taking up this journey to self teach most concepts of the language required as well as every other tool that is required in the process of decentrializing an application.

Please note as these are not all the programs i have written. There are many many that are still within completion and within testing.

I am proficient in undertstanding the tools required Framework required(truffle) Front end to interact with(drizzle) Test blockchain that is required to test transactions (Ganche-cli/Metamask) Language that write smart contracts(Solidity compiler language) Javascript frameworks (Angular-cli / react) Web script framework for contracts to interact with the blockchain(web3.js)

NOTE: I write all code in studio code as it now has an extension for compiling solidity, writing and reading solidity.

I will be uploading a repository soon containing all my flutter apps as i do wish to eventually incooporate the two. The best blockchain to deploy applications as well the flutter IDE/ framework to produce the best interactive UX.

Each project can always be improved on. I have taken the best kwowledge off the internet and youtube and created a small understanding of how these applications work. - this will constently be updated

There are solidity files that cannot be run or tested without the ganache-cli blockchain or metamask through the chrome browser. In order to run the seperate solidity tutorials -

Run the following commands:

npm install -g
npm install -g truffle
npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc
Start Ganache in admin: Check if truffle-config.js and ganache-cli port is the same port

To compile the project run:

truffle compile
To migrate the project run:

truffle migrate
To test the project run:

truffle test


This will install all project dependencies to get started with.
